# hover-intent
Hover-intent will add the class `.hover-intent` when the user's mouse hovers over a list item and is stationary for 0.25 seconds. Then the class `.hover-intent` will be removed when the user's mouse leaves the list item and is again stationary for 0.25 seconds. 

Practically meaning that the user's mouse can leave a list item, then return, without the class `.hover-intent` being removed, just so long as the mouse is not stationary for greater than 0.25 seconds before returning. Useful for nested dropdown menus.
